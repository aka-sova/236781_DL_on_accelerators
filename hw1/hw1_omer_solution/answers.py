part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**
1. A test set enables us to test our model after we finished training it and it will give us an estimation how
our model will preform in real conditions.
2.Test set will be chosen from our dataset, percentage of the test set and how we choose it can be modified.
3.In training the test set will not be used, but It will be used to evaluated performance of the trained model. When we
preform cross-validation a test set is different every iteration and the trained model is tested on it. This methods should
increase performance of the model.

Write your answer using **markdown** and $\LaTeX$:
```python
# A code block
a = 2
```
An equation: $e^{i\pi} -1 = 0$

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**

We always split our dataset into training,validation and test sets. Validation is the part were we fine tune our model 
parameters and prevent it from over fitting/under fitting and generalize it. It would be wrong to validate our model with a 
test set because it will overfit our model.
